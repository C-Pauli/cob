# Contributing
First of all, if you are reading this .... YOU ARE AWESOME! Thank you for considering contributing to
this project!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

If you have not already checked our [roadmap](https://github.com/LinkageIO/cob/issues/85), it should give you
and idea on our short and long term vision for the project. 

## COB Home Base
COB's [home base](https://github.com/LinkageIO/cob) is its github page, all of the "official" development will always 
ultimately make its way back to github. We follow a Fork/PR developement cycle. To contribute bug fixes, code changes,
new features, follow this example basic workflow which will add your name to the [contributors.md](https://github.com/schae234/cob/blob/master/Contributors.md) list!

### Basic Fork/PR Workflow Exercise
1. Fork the main github repo

2. Clone **your** github fork onto your computer

Navigate to your forked version of the repo and copy to URL to clone a local repo:
```
# The $ sign indicates a shell (bash) command
# Make sure its YOUR USERNAME!
$ git clone git@github.com:schae234/cob.git
Cloning into 'cob'...

remote: Compressing objects: 100% (86/86), done.
remote: Total 2816 (delta 62), reused 93 (delta 40), pack-reused 2685
Receiving objects: 100% (2816/2816), 57.26 MiB | 7.81 MiB/s, done.

$ cd cob
$ ls
cob                 Contributors.md  example-camoco.conf  MANIFEST.in       setup.py
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  Dockerfile       example-cob.conf     README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md     docs             LICENSE.md           requirements.txt
```
3. Commit and update changes to **your** local version
```
# Add YOUR NAME! to the contributors file
$ echo "Rob Schaefer" >> Contributors.md
# stage the changed file with git add
$ git add Contributors.md
# Commit your chnages!
$ git commit -m "Rob added his name"
[master e95e939] Rob added his name
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```
4. Push your changes to your github fork
```
# Push your changes 
$ git push origin master

```
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) to get your changes back into the main COB repo
Navigate to your GitHub page to open a PR

Github will detect any changes between your repo and the main COB repo. Double check that the changes make sense:

**Note:** You may need to resolve and differences that have been committed to the main COB repo that may have occurred during 
the time you were hacking.



## Continuous Integration
COB uses [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) to manage all of it's assets.
CI tools are great because they monitor the main github page and update resources whenever the repository is 
changed. 

For example, the code to generate the [documentation](https://linkageio-cob.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for COB 
lives in the GitHub repository, however whenever there is a change to the repo, readthedocs.org is sent a notification
and the live documentation is automatically updated. This means that the docs and the github repor are *always insync!*. 
Somtimes changes to the repo will result in an error in a CI (perhaps an unknown bug was introduced), these should be resolved
before a PR is accepted.
